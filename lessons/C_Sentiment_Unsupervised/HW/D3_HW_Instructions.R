## Your script header should be the following:
#' Title: GSERM REMOTE DAY 3 HW
#' Purpose: 20pts, evaluate polarity/sentiment/clustering
#' NAME: 
#' Date: 

## Keep in mind, there isn't a right, wrong answer here.  This text is small, and we are evaluating the code execution and appropriate sections, steps being taken more than results on this toy data.

# HW Tasks:
# 1. Apply 1 sentiment lexicon or polarity analysis to news.csv data.
# 2. Perform 1 clustering method with the news.csv data. 
# Considerations:  
# - The title, description and content columns are all ok to use as well as the combined title_description_content column.  
# - There is a column called newsSite with sources cnn, fox-news, msnbc, the-american-conservative.  You may analyze each news sources individually for your analysis (full credit) or into two groups i.e. right or left leaning (-1pt), or treat them as a single group thereby ignoring the column and just treating it as a single document set (-2 pts because its easiest)
